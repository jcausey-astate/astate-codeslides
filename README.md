# A-State Code Slides Format

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template jcausey-astate/astate-codeslides
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your article.

## Using

Place Quarto revealjs format slide decks in the "content" directory (or change `contents: "content/*.qmd"`) in the "template.qmd" file to point to your actual slides directory.

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal sample document: [template.qmd](template.qmd).

You should probably save this as your "index.qmd" or similar -- it should probably be the first page shown when you load your site.
